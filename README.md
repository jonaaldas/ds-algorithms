# Learning Path for DSA

This is how I am going to learn and the path I am following to learn DSA. I feel
DSA is very important topic to know even thou you do not plan to work for bid
tech. If you are like me and you like everyhting porgramming this topic should
excit you because the person and prohrammer you are going to become after is a
better one. Sure at the beggining it sucks and it's hard however with everyhting
in life the more you do it the better you get. The Preamegen said this quote
that always is un my head everytime I think of quiting learnig this. I am
paraphrasing here

> "Knowing DSA is like a secret handshake in the unstry that open the door for
> higher pay." - The Preamegen

After watching this video on how to learn DSA the path made sense to me and this
is the summary.
