// A tree data structure is a type of data structure that is used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements. It is composed of nodes, which represent the elements, and edges, which represent the relationships between them. Each node may have zero or more child nodes, and there is always a unique root node that has no parent. Trees are commonly used to represent file systems, data structures, and in computer science algorithms.

// Breath-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It starts at a specific vertex (the root) and visits all the vertices that are directly connected to it before moving on to the next level of vertices.

// BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices that have been visited but not explored yet. When a vertex is visited, it is added to the queue, and its adjacent vertices are added to the queue as well. The algorithm then dequeues the next vertex from the queue and repeats the process until all the vertices have been visited.

// BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph because it explores all the vertices in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. However, BFS is not suitable for graphs with a large number of edges because it requires a lot of memory to store the queue.
